# ðŸŽ§ Podcast (React)

The Podcast app is a single-page React application (SPA) that fetches podcast data from a public API and provides interactive features like:
- Searching podcasts by title
- Filtering by genre using global state for dropdown select components
- Sorting by A-Z, Z-A, oldest, newest, or default
- Viewing detailed podcast information (including seasons and episodes)
- Saving favorite episodes to local storage, including podcast image, name, description, and date/time saved
- A recommended podcasts section that fetches a random group of 10 podcasts on each refresh
- Theme toggle (light/dark) persisted in local storage
- Pagination to fetch and display podcasts in batches instead of all at once
